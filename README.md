## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to assess credit card risk using different machine learning algorithms. 


## Results

We tested multiple machine learning algorithms, and all of the balanced accuracy scores were around the same. A good balanced accuracy score is close to 1, and the results yielded a balanced accuracy score of about .6.

## Summary

I ran into an error when processing the ensemble analysis, however, aside from that, I did not see a significant difference between the different machine learning algorithms and, based on these results, any algorithm will work for this model.
